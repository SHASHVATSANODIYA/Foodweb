## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection issues | High | Medium | Implement robust reconnection with exponential backoff |
| Database performance | Medium | Low | Use connection pooling, proper indexing |
| JSON-RPC complexity | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing, clear error handling |
| Real-time sync issues | High | Medium | Event sourcing patterns, conflict resolution |
| Deployment complexity | Medium | Low | Docker containerization, automated CI/CD |

## üîß Technical Decisions

### State Management: Redux Toolkit
**Rationale**: Predictable state flow, excellent DevTools, time-travel debugging
**Trade-off**: More boilerplate vs Zustand's simplicity

### JSON-RPC vs REST
**Rationale**: Type safety, single endpoint, batch operations, introspection
**Trade-off**: Less familiar vs REST's ubiquity

### WebSocket Implementation
**Rationale**: Full control over connection lifecycle, custom back-pressure handling
**Trade-off**: More complexity vs Socket.io's features

### Database Schema
**Rationale**: Normalized design with proper constraints and indexes
**Trade-off**: Query complexity vs data integrity

## üìä Success Metrics

- [ ] Lighthouse score ‚â• 90 (mobile/desktop)
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection < 5s
- [ ] API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] Zero SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] 100% test coverage on critical paths
- [ ] Docker build time < 3 minutes
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline < 10 minutes

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

1. **Development**: Local docker-compose
2. **Staging**: Automated deployment on feature branches
3. **Production**: Manual promotion with health checks
